# UniNav
Geographic Information System (GIS)

UniNav is a comprehensive navigation application specifically designed for university campuses. It provides students, staff, and visitors with efficient and effective navigation tools, including real-time data, pathfinding algorithms, and customizable filters. Usability is enhanced through the prominent placement of important buttons and the use of color coding for varying street widths and aesthetics, including an automatic night mode for low light conditions. Filters cater to both general needs, such as finding banks, pharmacies, dentists, hospitals, and restaurants, and student-specific needs, including locating immigration offices, microwaves, bus stations, hospitals, and cheap/fast food options. UniNav keeps users updated with real-time information on BikeShare availability and road closures. The application offers multiple zoom levels to provide varying levels of detail, from large points of interest at the furthest zoom to the most detailed information at the highest zoom level.

To maximize navigation efficiency, UniNav features a search bar with auto-complete for street names and ensures quick response times through advanced algorithms. Pathfinding is powered by Dijkstra's Algorithm, which finds the shortest path between intersections, and an enhanced A* Algorithm that is 50% faster. The Multi-Dijkstra's Algorithm finds paths to multiple destinations from a single node, while the Greedy Approach and 2-Opt algorithms solve the Travelling Salesman Problem with a 13.7% improvement over standard methods. Testing ensures map responsiveness, with a target frame rate above 10 FPS, and heuristic evaluations have identified and addressed design issues, achieving a 97.5% score.

Additional features include the ability to simulate paths and visualize directions with arrows and path lines, and an AI chatbot that provides study spot recommendations, answers queries, and suggests residence listings based on user preferences. The application also enhances accessibility with speech recognition features. Future plans for UniNav include expanding to more locations and refining the AI-based recommendation system. UniNav is committed to providing a seamless and intuitive navigation experience for university campuses, enhancing accessibility and efficiency for all users.

also add i can not add code here because this is part of uoft course thus i am adding slies or final presentation

Unfortunately, I cannot add code here because this is part of a University of Toronto course, and thus I am adding slides or the final presentation instead.
